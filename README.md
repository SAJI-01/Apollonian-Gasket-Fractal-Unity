# Apollonian Gasket Fractal Unity

The **Apollonian Gasket** is a beautiful and infinitely complex fractal formed by recursively adding tangent circles inside a given space. This mathematical structure creates a mesmerizing pattern that appears in nature, art, and geometry.

## üåê How It Works

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Starts with Three Large Tangent Circles
- We begin with **three mutually tangent circles** (circles that touch each other).
- These three circles define a triangular gap between them.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Recursively Filling the Gaps
- A **fourth circle** is added inside the triangular gap, touching all three existing circles.
- The process is **repeated infinitely**, with each new gap being filled with a new tangent circle.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Infinite Complexity
- As the recursion continues, the circles become **smaller and denser**, forming a self-repeating fractal pattern.
- The structure appears **infinitely detailed**, no matter how much you zoom in.

## üìè Mathematical Properties
- The Apollonian Gasket follows **inversive geometry**, ensuring that each new circle is tangent to the others.
- The curvatures (\( k \), the reciprocal of the radii) of the circles obey **Descartes' Circle Theorem**:
  
  \[ (k_1 + k_2 + k_3 + k_4)^2 = 2(k_1^2 + k_2^2 + k_3^2 + k_4^2) \]

- The fractal has a **Hausdorff dimension** of approximately **1.3057**, meaning it is more complex than a 1D shape but less than a full 2D surface.
